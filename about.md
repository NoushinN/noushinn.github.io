Hello out there,

Firstly, I respectfully acknowledge that I live, work, and play on the ancestral, traditional, and uncededÂ territory of Lekwungen, the Songhees and Esquimalt First Nations.

I am a cell and molecular biologist and a data scientist in training. My first degree was an honours undergraduate degree in cellular and molecular biology at the University of Toronto with a co-op distinction where I gained hands-on laboratory experiences at Sanofi Pasteur working on HIV vaccine development using chicken embryos. I continued in biology and subsequently completed my doctorate in cell and systems biology from the University of Toronto in 2012. My doctorate developed an account of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in pre-osteoblastic stem cell differentiation to bone and explained why bone loss occurs in microgravity environments, a model that can shed light on astronauts losing bone during space travel or explain bone loss in disuse osteoporotic patients.  This work earned me a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) scholarship.

From 2012 to 2015, I moved to California to work on aging research projects using animal and cellular models with two of the leading scholars in the field of aging and enzymology. I worked as a Siebel Stem Cell fellow at Berkeley and a research scholar at UCSF (University of California).

I then moved back to Canada and led an 'omics' project from 2015 to 2018 on a rare cancer called malignant peritoneal mesothelioma as an Elevate Mitacs Fellow at the University of British Columbia and BC Cancer Research Centre. With this work, I assembled an international collaborative consortium with experts in the field of mesothelioma and published a novel genetic variant that can help 50% of patients with a targeted drug. 

Since 2018, I have transitioned to working on data-intensive science projects related to health and epidemiology in the public domain.  My diverse background in basic and applied science and statistics leads me to apply a multidisciplinary and creative approach to doing research. I deeply enjoy working with code (SQL and R), solving complex problems, and exploring new ideas.

In my free time, I enjoy experimentation with cooking, painting, hiking, and spending time with family and friends.
