Hello out there,

Firstly, I respectfully acknowledge that I live, work, and play on the ancestral, traditional, and uncededÂ territory of Lekwungen, the Songhees and Esquimalt First Nations.

I am a cell and molecular biologist and a data scientist in training. My first degree was an honours undergraduate degree in cellular and molecular biology at the University of Toronto with a co-op distinction where I gained hands-on laboratory experiences at Sanofi Pasteur working on HIV vaccine development using chicken embryos. I continued in biology and subsequently completed my doctorate in cell and systems biology at the University of Toronto in 2012. My doctorate developed an account of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in pre-osteoblastic stem cell differentiation to bone and explained why bone loss occurs in microgravity environments, a model that can shed light on astronauts losing bone during space travel or explain bone loss in disuse [osteoarthritic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/art.38256) patients.  This work earned me a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) scholarship.

From 2012 to 2015, I went to California to work on aging research projects using animal and cellular models with two of the leading scholars in the field of aging and enzymology. I worked as a Siebel Stem Cell fellow at Berkeley and at UCSF (University of California). During this time, I worked on deciphering the role of sirtuin genes in aging and disease. As well, I worked on devising methods for measurements of enzymatic turnover of cytochromes in the presence of drugs in liver cells. Both of these projects were published in peer-reviewed journals prior to my move back to Canada to led an 'omics' project.

From 2015 to 2018, I worked on a rare cancer called malignant peritoneal mesothelioma as an Elevate Mitacs Fellow at the University of British Columbia and BC Cancer Research Centre. I assembled an international collaborative consortium with experts in the field of mesothelioma and published novel genetic variants of the disease that can help 50% of patients with a targeted drug. 

Since 2018, I have transitioned to working on data-intensive science projects related to health and epidemiology in the public domain.  My diverse background in basic and applied science and statistics leads me to apply a multidisciplinary and creative approach to doing research. I deeply enjoy coding, solving complex problems, and exploring new ideas.
