Noushin Nabavi earned a B.Sc. in 2005 in Cell and Molecular Biology and a PhD in Cell and Systems Biology from the University of Toronto in 2012. Her doctorate thesis developed an account of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in pre-osteoblastic stem cell differentiation to bone and explained why bone loss occurs in microgravity environments, a model that can shed light on astronauts losing bone during space travel or explain bone loss in disuse osteoarthritic patients. She then earned a Siebel Stem Cell Fellowship from the University of California, Berkeley (2012-2013) and worked on aging using animal and cellular models of disease. As a visiting scientist (2013-2015), she developed in vitro assays for drug metabolism with a leading scholar in the field of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the University of California, San Francisco. Subsequently, from 2015 to 2018, Dr. Nabavi led a transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics project at the BC Cancer Research Centre on the rare mesothelioma cancer. For this, she assembled an international consortium of experts, wrote successful grant applications, and published her work in peer-reviewed journals. Since 2018, she has joined the civil service and uses large data to enable evidence-based decision making.
